        <h2>Let's talk about food</h2>
        <p>
          Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an
          organism.[2] It can be raw, processed or formulated and is consumed
          orally by animals for growth, health or pleasure. Food is mainly
          composed of water, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals (e.g
          salts) and organic substances (e.g vitamins) can also be found in
          food.[3] Plants, algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to
          make their own food molecules.[4] Water is found in many foods and has
          been defined as a food by itself.[5] Food provides energy and
          nutrition to the organism. Water and fiber have low energy densities,
          or calories, while fat is the most energy dense component.[6]

          Human food can be classified in various ways, either by related
          content or by how the food is processed.[7] The number and composition
          of food groups can vary. Most systems include four basic groups that
          describe their origin and relative nutritional function: Vegetables
          and Fruit, Cereals and Bread, Dairy, and Meat.[8] Studies that look
          into diet quality often group food into whole grains/cereals, refined
          grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy
          products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened
          beverages.[9][10][11] The Food and Agriculture Organization and World
          Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications:
          cereals, roots, pulses and nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat,
          insects, vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, spices
          and condiments, beverages, foods for nutritional uses, food additives,
          composite dishes and savoury snacks.[12]
